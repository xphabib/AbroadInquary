  <br />
  <p>If you are unable to meet this appointment or wish to object, please cancel this appointment 48 hours earlier from your dashboard scheduling system.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Note: Appointments that are canceled by the student within 48 hours before the mentorship will not be charged; therefore Abroad Inquiry will be unable to pay the schedule cost. You can also cancel the appointment within 48 hours earlier. Thank you.</p>
